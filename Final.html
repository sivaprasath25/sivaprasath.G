      <h3>QUIZ APP</h3>
      <p>Firstly, we  have to make interfaces for Home Page,  Login Page, Questions  Attempting forum, Result Page, & Profile of user. These all pages have connectivity with the server and database. So, that it can work properly. Currently, there are websites which only provide limited number of quizzes  related  to  different  domain.  Many  websites  do  not  have  a  single  platform  for  quizzes related to technical, G.K, Aptitude, Games, etc. And there is not a website where the users can upload his/her questions and answers for the others. We  have  to  develop  an  application which can resolve all of the above problems. By this user can gain knowledge, can solve his/her query, and spread his/her knowledge among the world</p>

      <h3>Covid Awareness</h3>
      <p>Itâ€™s been so long since covid came, we witnessed the first wave, then the super dangerous delta variant and now there is the Omicron variant. All glories to the great scientists and doctors for making vaccines in such a short duration and to the government for making the vaccine available at such a large scale that we are in a safer state now than we could have been without the vaccines.

You might be wondering why I am discussing this now. Well, this is the idea for our tenth project, making a covid 19 awareness website. This will involve the general guidelines that people must follow, the need and importance of vaccination, and the need to stay in isolation in case one experiences symptoms. In short a general-purpose awareness website.</p>
